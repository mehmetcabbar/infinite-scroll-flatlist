### Why I published this code in my github repo?  
Finding basic, simple and usefull code it can be pain the ass, sometimes!  <br/> I have a simple reason "because I need that this code lines, always!".  I realized, when I was working on some projects, some code lines is so popular on my apps. I want to create a main point for myself and of course, share to anyone who need that! <br/>
